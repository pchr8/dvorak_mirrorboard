# dvorak_mirrorboard
A heavily modified Dvorak version of the MirrorBoard, now called Pchr8board
Previous versions sadly gone because I am learning to use git push -f :)
Regardless, this is the keyboard I currently use. It's based on Randall Munroe's Mirrorboard, more details here:

It adds a "latch" key that can be used to type with your left hand using a mirrored Dvorak keyboard. The last third version adds arrow keys on the right hand  and a backspace, so that I don't have 
to change my arms' position to reach them.
